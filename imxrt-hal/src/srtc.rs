//! Secure Real-Time Clock
//!
//! Basic support only: Supports enabling and setting the clock, but not any of its more
//! advanced features (alarm, calibration, stop on security violation, etc).
//!
//! The Secure Real-Time Clock continues tracking time until it is specifically disabled or loses
//! power, even through a system reboot (and potentially a loss of power to the system, if the
//! SRTC is connected to a battery).
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use imxrt_hal;
//!
//! let mut peripherals = imxrt_hal::Peripherals::take().unwrap();
//!
//! let mut srtc = peripherals.srtc.enable_and_set(&mut peripherals.ccm.handle, 1600000000, 0);
//! // Interpreted as Unix time: Sep 13 2020 12:26:40.000
//!
//! let now = srtc.get();
//! ```
//!
//! # Teensy 4.x Note
//!
//! When the SRTC is enabled, setting the board into program mode then using the Teensy Loader
//! application (GUI) to reboot it will set the current time (Unix epoch, but time in local
//! timezone). This will overwrite whatever time you may have previously set.
