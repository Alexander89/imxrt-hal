//! (Secure) Real-Time Clock
//!
//! Basic support only: Supports enabling and setting the clocks, but not any of their more
//! advanced features (alarm, interrupt, power glitch detection, etc).
//!
//! The Secure Real-Time Clock continues tracking time until it is specifically disabled or loses
//! power, even through a system reboot (and potentially a loss of power to the system, if the
//! SRTC is connected to a battery).
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use imxrt_hal;
//!
//! let mut peripherals = imxrt_hal::Peripherals::take().unwrap();
//!
//! let mut rtc = peripherals.rtc.enable_and_set(1600000000);
//! // Interpreted as Unix time: Sep 13 2020 12:26:40
//!
//! let now = rtc.get();
//! ```
//!
//! # Teensy 4.x Note
//!
//! When the SRTC is enabled, setting the board into program mode then using the Teensy Loader
//! to reboot it will set the current time (Unix epoch, but time in local timezone). This will
//! overwrite whatever time you may have previously set.
