### Changed

- `imxrt_hal::pit::Unclocked::clock` now takes a `&mut imxrt_hal::ccm::perclk::Configured` mutable reference, rather
  than a value. Users need to add a `&mut` qualifier to the `clock()` argument, and qualify the `Configured`
  object as `mut` to migrate their code. The object may now be shared between PIT and GPT clocking methods.

Prior releases were not tracked with a changelog entry.
