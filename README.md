# i.MX RT Crates

i.MX RT register access layer, hardware abstraction layer, and svd patches.

This is very much modeled on the great stm32ral and stm32-rs crates which do 
much the same for ST's fantastic STM32 family.

## Goals

* Create *the* collaborative group to support using Rust on NXP's i.MX RT series.
* Fast compilation
* Embedded HAL support.
* RTFM support.
* EVK board support
* Popular boards such as the Teensy 4.

## Supported Devices

* imxrt1011
* imxrt1015
* imxrt1021
* imxrt1051
* imxrt1052
* imxrt1061
